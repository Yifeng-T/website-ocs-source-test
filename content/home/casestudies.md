# Open Case Studies

## What do we mean by a _case study_ ?

Here, we define the term _case study_ as an illustrative, complete data analysis in a real-world application, such as addressing obesity and risks to adolescent health:

1. Begins with an interesting scientific question or application for motivation.
  * _Can we better identify patients in young, minority populations at risk for diabetes?_
2. Discusses how to access, gather, import, clean, and visualize data. 
  * _Data from electronic health records_
3. Exposes students to the thought process of combining computational and programming aspects with statistical concepts in a concrete example of data analysis. This is different from teaching either a programing language or a statistical methods class individually. 
  * _How can I use Monte Carlo simulations to simulate health outcomes? What does 'relative risk' mean? Can I use machine learning to predict outcomes?_
4. Illustrates nontrivial solutions that leave room for different analyses of the data.
  * _Are there possible biases to account for in the prediction model (e.g. selection bias, geographic information)?_
5. Teaches the student to effectively communicate results and to make connections between the scientific question, data and statistical concepts that only come from hands-on experience analyzing data.


## Available Open Case Studies

We are actively working on creating case studies and this is
the current list of available case studies:   

* Exploring health expenditure in the United States:  [[description](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-healthexpenditure/blob/master/README.md)] [[case study](casestudies/ocs-healthexpenditure.html)] [[code](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-healthexpenditure)]

* Examine relationship between fatal police shootings and firearm legislation in the United States:  [[description](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-police-shootings-firearm-legislation/blob/master/README.md)] [[case study](casestudies/ocs-police-shootings-firearm-legislation.html)] [[code](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-police-shootings-firearm-legislation)]

If you would like to contribute a case study to the repository, 
or have suggestions on data sets to use to build a case study around, 
please contact us!
